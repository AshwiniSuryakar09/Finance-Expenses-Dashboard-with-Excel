# Finance-Expenses-Dashboard-with-Excel

##   With the Finance Expenses dashboard I created in Excel, I gained clear insights into my monthly income and expenses using a pivot table. It helped me track spending by subcategory, I compared income vs. expenses, and identified areas to save money. This dashboard is crucial for middle-class families to manage finances effectively and ensure their hard-earned money is spent wisely.

> ## Explaination :

### 1.With this finance expenses dashboard that I developed in Excel, I got to know exactly where my money is going each month. 

### 2.By creating a pivot table, I was able to analyze the dataset and get key insights, such as monthly expenses broken down by subcategory. This helped me understand which areas I’m spending the most on, whether it’s groceries, utilities, entertainment, or other expenses.

### 3.I also got a clear picture of my total income and expenses per month, which allowed me to compare them side by side. This gave me a better understanding of my financial health and whether I was saving enough or overspending in certain months.

### 4.Having this dashboard is important, especially for a middle-class family, because it provides a clear and detailed breakdown of expenses. 

### 5.It helps in tracking spending patterns, identifying unnecessary expenses, and making better financial decisions. With this information, families can plan their budget more effectively and ensure they are saving their hard-earned money instead of unknowingly overspending.
